            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

If any opportunity of Service be preſented, either there is no notice take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of it, or to ſave a little charges, it is neglected, or none knowes how to improve it. Dangers imminent, are either not fore-ſeen, or ſlighted: Traitors creepe in, that diſcover their Councels to their enemies. There are jealouſies &amp; factions among their great men, in favour whereof, one ſtudies to croſſe the deſignes and ſucceſſes of the other, though the Publike be undone by it. The Treaſury is wasted in needleſſe expences; the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers mutine and are ſeditious, and when they have plundered a Country, must have as much given them to forbeare plundering as would maintain a war. Finally, while all ſeek their own profit, &amp; no mans heart is upon the Publike good, all runs to ruine. On the contrary, the enemies whom God intends to puniſh that people by,
<pb facs="tcp:154850:4"/>
though they be far more wicked and ungodly, yet they proſper, their courage, their ſtrength increaſes; they take opportune counſels, they know how to improve &amp; pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue advantages; there is great concord among their Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; no man ſeeks to undermine &amp; overthrow another; no man blends his own private quarrels with the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Cauſe. In a word, all things ſucceed as if God favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their cauſe, &amp; directed their counſels, when yet their cauſe is unjust, and their intentions wicked, and there is nothing further from their heart then God.</q>

               <hi>Elders</hi> expreſſing a pious ſenſe of this breach that <hi>God</hi> had made upon them.

            </p>
            <p>The thing that God <hi>tooke notice</hi> of in <hi>Joſhua</hi> was the Deepe ſence he had of the hand of God againſt Iſrael in the late <hi>diſaſter</hi> that befell their <hi>Army:</hi> under which he lay confounded, aſtoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed at the feet of God.

            </p>
            <p>The thing which God <hi>gave notice</hi> of to <hi>Joſhua</hi> was the <hi>ſinne</hi> that <hi>Iſrael</hi> had committed which was the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of this <hi>Diſaſter. Iſrael hath ſinned, and hath alſo tranſgreſſed my Covenant which I commanded them.</hi>

               <note place="margin">with The Proofe.</note> From the firſt of theſe I commend this to your Obſervation. <hi>That when a Diſaster befals the Armies of Iſrael, it well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a generous Gratious heart to be deeply affected with it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſay, when a <hi>Diſaſter</hi> befals the Armies of Iſrael, for this here it was not a <hi>Diſcomfiture,</hi> it was but a <hi>Diſaſter:</hi> a <hi>Party</hi> of about <hi>three thouſand</hi> beaten, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. and about <hi>ſix and thirty</hi> men ſlaine in the fight, and in the Chaſe, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. What's that in an Army of <hi>ſix hundred thouſand</hi> men of warre? That was Iſraels Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber at their laſt Muſter. <hi>Numb.</hi> 26.51. Some <hi>Nimrod,</hi> ſome <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clops</hi> would have thought this an inconſiderable loſſe, a blow not worth the taking notice of. But <hi>Joſhua,</hi> though as gallant and daring a ſpirit as any the Earth had, he thinkes not ſo: he thinks that this cals him and the reſt of the Elders of Iſrael (what ever others doe) to rend their Clothes, and put duſt upon their heads, and in the mournfulleſt plight that may be to poure out their Prayers and Teares before the <hi>Lord: O Lord! what ſhall I ſay?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So when the <hi>Children of Iſrael</hi> were ſmitten before <hi>Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min,</hi> though that was <hi>not ſuch a diſcomfiture,</hi> but they were able to rally themſelves againe, and renew the fight a ſecond and third time, and at length got the victory by fine force; yet <hi>All the people went up and wept before the Lord.</hi> Judg. 20. Once and a ſecond time, and the ſecond time <hi>they wept and faſted untill E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings unto the Lord. ver.</hi> 26. This a <hi>Diſaster</hi> will worke.</p>

Good man unhappy in his Government, unhappy in his ſons, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py only in this that he <hi>died with griefe for the Iſrael and Ark of God:</hi> ſo deeply was his tender gratious heart affected with the <hi>diſaſter</hi> of Iſraels Army.</p>

               <label>Reaſons.</label>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, ſome proportion of ſuch like affection might well become every <hi>tender</hi> and <hi>gratious</hi> heart in ſuch occaſions. Firſt, Becauſe every <hi>gratious</hi> heart, (and indeed every <hi>generous</hi> heart, every man that hath not the heart of an <hi>Atheiſt</hi> in him) knowes, that when a <hi>diſaſter</hi> befals the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God in their Armies, it is a ſigne that God is diſpleaſed with his people. Every <hi>diſaſter</hi> that befals their Armies, is a <hi>check,</hi> a <hi>frowne,</hi> a <hi>rebuke</hi> from <hi>God,</hi> a token of his <hi>diſpleaſure,</hi> and therefore a gratious heart cannot ſtand under it: <hi>This</hi> is it perplexeth <hi>Joſhua</hi> here. Alas the death of 36. men it had been nothing: The ſlaughter of 36000. it had been nothing, had their Army yet had the favour of God upon them. But <hi>God is angry; Joſhuah's</hi> tender heart can feele it in this lighter ſtroake as well as if the blow had been heavier, God is angry, therefore <hi>Iſrael cannot ſtand before their enemie, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> Joſhua <hi>cannot ſtand before the Lord,</hi> but falls at his feet ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:154850:6"/>
               <hi>ô Lord what ſhall I ſay unto thee?</hi> And whom would not this become? whom would not this become? when God ſhewes himſelfe angry with his people, to ſhew themſelves deepely ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of it, to cloath themſelves with trembling and with mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, whom would it not become? I am ſure it would become us this day, the <hi>Lord</hi> helpe us ſo to doe.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, When any <hi>diſaster</hi> befalls the Armies of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> it well becomes a generous gratious heart to be deeply affected with it; becauſe <hi>diſaſters</hi> in the Armies of <hi>Iſrael</hi> are of very <hi>ſad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence.</hi> This <hi>Joſhua</hi> had his <hi>eye</hi> upon, and this his <hi>heart</hi> was affected with, as you may ſee, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. <hi>For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the Land ſhall heare of it, and ſhall inviron us round, and cut off our name from the earth; and what wilt thou doe to thy great Name.</hi> There are two things mentioned as the ſad conſequence of this <hi>diſaſter.</hi> Firſt, The increaſe of <hi>rage</hi> and <hi>courage</hi> againſt the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God that this would occaſon to their <hi>enemies. The Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the Land ſhall heare of it, and ſhall environ us round, and cut off our name from off the earth.</hi> One <hi>diſaſter</hi> will make thoſe to whom <hi>Iſrael</hi> was before terrible, reſume new courage, and enter into new confederacies, and nothing will now ſatisfie but utter extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; <hi>cutting off the name of Iſrael from the earth.</hi> In this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect; it well becomes <hi>a generous gratious</hi> heart, as he tenders the good and wellfare of the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God, to be deepely affected with ſuch diſaſters.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, And as ſuch diſaſters increaſe the <hi>rage</hi> of the <hi>enemies</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Iſrael of God,</hi> ſo againſt the <hi>God of Iſrael</hi> himſelf: this is intimated in the laſt words of the ninth verſe, <hi>and what wilt thou doe unto thy great Name?</hi> as if <hi>Joſhua</hi> had ſaid. <hi>Lord,</hi> though our name were cut off from the earth for ever it were no matter; But ô the reproach, the ſcorne that theſe uncircumciſed ones will caſt upon thy <hi>great and dreadfull Name!</hi> ô to heare the enemies inſulting, where is your God that brought you up out of the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> where are all thoſe mighty wonders which he wrought at the Red Sea and in the Land of <hi>Ham,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Joſhuah</hi> knew that theſe would be the <hi>darings,</hi> this the <hi>language</hi> of the enemies, and his gratious heart cannot beare it: <hi>ô what wilt thou doe to thy great Name?</hi> If then in the <hi>diſaſters</hi> of an Army, we may <hi>ſee</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:154850:7"/>
that <hi>God is provoked,</hi> and <hi>fore-ſee</hi> that the <hi>glory of God</hi> and the <hi>ſafety of his people</hi> is much <hi>endangered;</hi> we may conclude, <hi>It well becomes a generous gratious heart to be much affected with ſuch diſaſters.</hi>

               <label>Application of it.</label> The Application of this Truth is eaſie.

For it is ſaid of him in the 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 12.1. that <hi>he forſooke the Law of the Lord, he and all Iſrael with him.</hi> And if you would know what was the degree and meaſure of their wickedneſſe, how farre he and his people had forſaken the Law of the Lord; looke in 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 14.22, 23, 24. and reade what their wickedneſſe was. <hi>And Judah did evill in the ſight of the Lord, and they provoked
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:154850:10"/>
him to jealouſie with their ſinnes which they had committed, above all that their fathers had done. For they alſo built them high places, and images, and groves on every high hill, and under every greene tree. And there were alſo Sodomites in the land, and they did according to all the abominations of the nations which the Lord cast out before the Children of Iſrael.</hi> Theſe ſinnes within a very few yeares after <hi>Rehoboams</hi> comming to the Crowne had made them ripe for the judgement of the ſword: for ſo 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 12.2. <hi>In the fifth yeere of Rehoboam King of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah, Shiſhak king of Egypt came up againſt Jeruſalem, becauſe they had tranſgreſſed againſt the Lord.</hi> The terrour of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion is ſuch as <hi>Rehoboam</hi> and his Princes cannot but humble themſelves, <hi>Whereupon the Princes of Iſrael, and the King hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled themſelves, and they ſaid, The Lord is righteous.</hi> ver. 6. Now doth the Lord deſpiſe their Humiliations, becauſe they had been an idolatrous, uncleane, wretched people? No <hi>reade</hi> and <hi>wonder</hi> at the goodneſſe of our <hi>God</hi> towards humbled ſinners, ver. 7. <hi>And when the Lord ſaw that they humbled themſelves;</hi> (ſo then God tooke notice of this even in theſe) <hi>the word of the Lord came to Shemaiah, ſaying, They have humbled themſelves,</hi> therefore <hi>I will not deſtroy them, but I will give them ſome deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, and my wrath ſhall not be poured out upon Jeruſalem, by the hand of Shiſhak.</hi> And becauſe God would have us take good notice of this his reſpect unto their Humiliations, the holy Ghoſt mentions it againe in the 12. verſe. <hi>And when he humbled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, the wrath of the Lord turned away from him, that he would not deſtroy him altogether: and alſo in Judah things went well.</hi> God did not only deliver him out of his preſent danger, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpered all the affaires of his Kingdome in his hand; and yet certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he (even after this his Humiliation) none of the beſt men, as we may collect from that Cenſure which after this the Lord leaves of him. ver. 14. <hi>And he did evill, becauſe he prepared not his heart to ſeeke the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My next Inſtance ſhall be of a <hi>Man</hi> who was ſo farre from ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any thing of <hi>Piety</hi> at all in him, that he was a man of the moſt tranſcendent <hi>Impiety</hi> that ever any (almoſt) was. King <hi>Ahab</hi> is the man: Doe but remember what the holy Ghoſt ſaith of him. It is ſaid 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 16.30. <hi>That Ahab did evill in the ſight
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:154850:11"/>
of the Lord, above all that were before him,</hi> and ver. 33. <hi>he did more to provoke the Lord God of Iſrael to anger, then all the Kings of Iſrael that were before him.</hi> and in 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21.25. <hi>But there was none like to Ahab,</hi> &amp;c. None of all that went before him or came after him like to him in wickedneſſe. There were <hi>twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> Kings in Iſrael from the time that the ten Tribes revolted from the houſe of <hi>David,</hi> to the time that God removed them out of his ſight. Of theſe <hi>twenty</hi> Kings there was onely <hi>One</hi> good, <hi>Jehu.</hi> And yet his Integritie may be doubted too. But the other <hi>nineteen</hi> were <hi>all</hi> wicked, and yet not <hi>One</hi> among them all to be compared to <hi>Ahab. But there was none like unto Ahab.</hi> An <hi>Oppreſſour</hi> he was, and a <hi>murtherer,</hi> and an <hi>idolater,</hi> and a <hi>perſecuter</hi> of that holy <hi>Truth</hi> which God had <hi>plentifully</hi> revealed to him by his <hi>Prophets,</hi> and <hi>powerfully</hi> confirmed to him by <hi>miracles,</hi> and <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully</hi> ſought to endeare to him by many gratious deliverances. There were not ſuch Prophets in Iſrael in any Kings dayes as were in his: Nor ſuch miracles wrought as in his: Nor had any King more glorious Victories and Deliverances, and Providences mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted towards him then he had: and therefore in all likelihood he was an <hi>obſtinate ſinner,</hi> and as ſome thinke very neere the ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt. This is that King <hi>Ahab</hi> againſt whom God by his ſervant <hi>Elijah</hi> thunders dreadfull things, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21.20, 21, 22, 23, 24. The very hearing whereof <hi>ſomething</hi> breakes the pride of his heart, ver. 27. <hi>And it came to paſſe that when Ahab heard thoſe words, he rent his clothes, and put ſackcloth upon his fleſh, and faſted, and lay in ſackcloth, and went ſoftly.</hi> But will <hi>God</hi> regard it? cares <hi>God</hi> for <hi>Ahab?</hi> Truly we ſhould have been ready to thinke, that if ſuch a wretch as <hi>Ahab</hi> ſhould not onely have <hi>rent his clothes,</hi> but have <hi>rent his fleſh, his heart:</hi> ſhould he not only <hi>have faſted,</hi> but have <hi>ſtarved,</hi> not only have <hi>ſhed Teares,</hi> but <hi>Bloud;</hi> all this ſhould never have prevailed with <hi>God</hi> to <hi>relent</hi> any thing at all towards him; or <hi>reverſe</hi> one <hi>Tittle</hi> of the wrath denounced againſt him, we would have thought ſo; had not <hi>God</hi> left the contrary upon record in his holy word; to teach us, <hi>That his thoughts are not as our thoughts, nor his wayes as our wayes.</hi> Therefore the word of the <hi>Lord</hi> came to <hi>Elijah</hi> ſaying, <hi>Seeſt thou how Ahab humbleth himſelf before me? becauſe Ahab humbleth himſelfe before me, I will not bring the evill in

            <p>Or were I to ſpeake this day to the Miniſtry of <hi>England</hi> that are rightly affected to the glory of <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>Publike good:</hi> I would intreat them to conſider with me, whether we may not feare that ſome of our former ſins in the matter of Gods Day and Worſhip may at this time come in remembrance before the Lord (eſpecially ſeeing we have been no more humbled for them?) and whether our preſent diviſions and diſſentions, and the undue managing of them may not have an influence into our preſent calamities? I remember in the beginning of the firſt Reformation there fell an unhappy difference between <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> and <hi>Zuinglius,</hi> and their followers, which was managed with a great deale of bitterneſſe, and remaines to this day un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſed.

But I digreſſe too farre: to returne therefore to my preſent Auditory.</p>
            <p>You that ſtand here before the Lord this day (Men and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren)
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:154850:19"/>
I beſeech you every one aske your owne Conſciences, and ſay, <hi>What have I done?</hi> what ſinne is it of mine that hath awakened this hand of God againſt us?</p>
            <p>Is it my unſenſibleneſſe of the indignation of the Lord in this civill deſtructive warre? Is it my pride, my luxurie, my eating fleſh, my drinking wine, my clothing my ſelfe with ſcarlet, my walking with an out-ſtretched neck at ſuch a time as this, when the Lord cals to weeping, and mourning, and baldneſſe, and girding with ſackcloth every day? Beleeve it, brethren, it is a great provocation in the eyes of our <hi>God</hi> to behold ſo much bravery and joviality as he ſees every day in this great Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie at ſuch a time as this, when he is making his ſword drunke with the bloud of our ſlaine. There are three Texts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Oh that all the children of pride and vanity would but ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 21.9.10. <hi>A ſword, a ſword it is ſharpened, and alſo fourbiſhed. It is ſharpened to make a ſore ſlaughter; it is fourbiſhed, that it may glitter: ſhould we then make mirth?</hi> Iſai. 22.12, 13. <hi>And in that day did the Lord God of hoſts call to weeping and to mourning, and to baldneſſe and to girding with ſackcloth. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, joy and gladneſſe, ſlaying oxen, and killing ſheep, eating fleſh, and dinking wine.</hi> Iſai. 3.16-25, 26. <hi>Moreover, the Lord ſaith, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the daughters of Zion are haughtie, and walke with ſtretched forth neckes, and wanton eyes, walking and mincing as they goe, and making a tinkling with their feet. Therefore thy men ſhall fall by the ſword and thy mighty in the warre. And her gates ſhall la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and mourne, and ſhe being deſolate ſhall ſit upon the ground.</hi> Little doe our <hi>Ladies</hi> thinke that their Gallantry (which that third of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> gives an Inventory of) may make <hi>our mighty men fall in the warre,</hi> and our ſtrongeſt Cities ſit upon the ground.</p>
            <p>But, ſay againe: Is it my truſting to an arme of fleſh, my putting confidence in the Gallantry of our Army (and ah Lord! in this thing, the Lord be mercifull to us, who almoſt can plead <hi>Not guilty</hi>) that hath made this Arme of fleſh to wither? Is it my neglect of Prayer? Am I the man that when I heard our Army was in ſtreights; nay, when his <hi>Excellencie</hi> ſent to deſire Prayers, my wretched heart would not lift up <hi>one Prayer:</hi> Nay, if it were to doe again, if <hi>One Prayer</hi> would <hi>ſave the Army, ſave

the Kingdome,</hi> I could not doe it? Am I the man that have with thoſe perverſe <hi>Iſraelites</hi> deſpiſed the <hi>pleaſant Land,</hi> the <hi>Land of deſires,</hi> as it is <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.24. When <hi>Iſrael</hi> was in <hi>Egypt</hi> there was nothing they deſired more then the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> when they were come out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and were upon the borders of that Land, then they deſpiſed it, and wiſhed themſelves in <hi>Egypt</hi> againe. ô that it were not ſo with us: It is not long ſince a <hi>Parliament,</hi> an <hi>Aſſembly of Godly Divines,</hi> the <hi>Reformation</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> in <hi>Doctrine, Worſhip,</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline</hi> was the deſire of all the well-affected in the Nation. But now the <hi>Parliament</hi>—the <hi>Aſſembly of Divines</hi> deſpiſed. The <hi>Reformation</hi> (which we are now even upon the borders of) in <hi>Doctrine, Worſhip, Diſcipline,</hi> deſpiſed. Men wiſh themſelves in <hi>Egypt</hi> againe. And had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be under <hi>Prelaticall Bondage</hi> then under a <hi>Government</hi> moſt conforme to the Word, and to the Government of other <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches. No Reformation</hi> of Religion now: now nothing will ſatisfie <hi>ſome</hi> but a <hi>Toleration of all Religions</hi> and <hi>all Opinions.

            </p>
            <p>It were an endleſſe taske to enumerate the reſt of the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſins that poſſibly the people of this City and this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome may be guilty of: and that <hi>God</hi> may have his <hi>Eye</hi> and <hi>Hand</hi> upon in this <hi>Rebuke</hi> that he hath given us. And therefore I muſt not proſecute this any further. Only againe, I beſeech you all, <hi>Lords, Gentlemen, Souldiers, Miniſters, Men, Women,</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one of you ſay to your ſelves, <hi>Sure we have ſinned. Iſrael hath ſinned;</hi> and every one of you aske your owne Conſciences, ſaying, <hi>What have I done?</hi> And let us all in the feare of <hi>God</hi> make it one part of this dayes Supplications, that <hi>God</hi> would pleaſe to ſhew us where this ſinne is, and ſay with <hi>Job,</hi> Chap. 10.2. <hi>Shew us wherefore thou contendeſt with us.</hi>

            <p>And if you pleaſe to take but one view more of the Text, <hi>God</hi> may pleaſe to ſhew us ſomething more then we yet ſee. <hi>Iſrael hath ſinned,</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>and they have alſo tranſgreſſed my Covenant;</hi> wherein the <hi>Lord</hi> lets <hi>Joſhua</hi> underſtand, that as <hi>ſin</hi>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Obſerv."/> 
               <hi>That the violation of the Covenant of God is ſuch a ſinne as will make Iſrael turne their back before their Enemies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I doe not intend a large diſcourſe about <hi>violation of Covenant,</hi> to ſet out the odious &amp; provoking nature of that ſin. I ſhall only briefly doe two things. Firſt, I ſhall ſhew how a Covenant may be called the Covenant of God. Secondly, I ſhall proove that the breach of any Covenant that may be ſo called, is ſuch a ſinne as will make <hi>Iſrael</hi> turne their backs before their Enemies. For the firſt of theſe; How a <hi>Covenant</hi> may be called a <hi>Covenant of God.</hi> For of <hi>ſuch a Covenant</hi> the Text ſpeakes; <hi>They have tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed</hi> My <hi>Covenant:</hi> and ſo the Doctrine, <hi>the violation of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> of God, &amp;c. Now a Covenant may be ſaid to be a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of God, two wayes. 1 Either <hi>per modum obligationis: or</hi> 2. <hi>Per modum atteſtationis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>per modum obligationis,</hi> when we do directly and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ingage and bind our ſelves unto God, when God is the <hi>Party</hi> covenanted with, as in our <hi>Sacramentall</hi> Covenants, and in all Covenants <hi>purely Religious</hi> both for matter and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
            <p>Or elſe a Covenant may be ſaid to be the Covenant of God, <hi>per modum atteſtationis,</hi> when a Covenant (though made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene two equall parties) is yet made in the <hi>Name of God,</hi> and in the <hi>Sight of God; God</hi> is called to be a <hi>witneſſe to it,</hi> and an <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venger of the Breach of it.</hi> So in that Covenant that <hi>Laban</hi> made betweene himſelfe and <hi>Iacob. Gen.</hi> 31.44. <hi>Come let us make a Covenant, I and thou,</hi> and marke what he ſaith after this Covenant, <hi>ver.</hi> 50. <hi>God is a witneſſe betweene me and thee:</hi> Such a <hi>Covenant</hi> as this, wherein the <hi>Obligation</hi> is unto <hi>Man,</hi> made in the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>God, God</hi> counts his <hi>owne,</hi> no leſſe then a <hi>Covenant,</hi> the <hi>Obligation</hi> whereof is immediately to <hi>himſelfe:</hi> ſo you find <hi>Ezek.</hi> 17. the Covenant which the <hi>King of Iudah</hi> had made with the <hi>King of Babylon,</hi> God calls <hi>his Oath</hi> and <hi>his Covenant, ver.</hi> 19. <hi>Mine Oath that he hath diſpiſed, and my Covenant that he hath broken, even it will I recompenſe upon his head.</hi> Now
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:154850:20"/>
the Doctrine comprehends both theſe, and tels us <hi>that the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Covenant</hi> of God, (that is of a Covenant either made directly and immediately with God; or made with others in the name and in the ſight of God) <hi>is ſuch a ſin,</hi> as will make <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el turne their back before their Enemies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the proofe of this (which is the ſecond thing I have to doe) beſides the Text before us, I ſhall onely bring a Text or two, looke in the 78. <hi>Pſal. ver.</hi> 9, 10. you ſhall reade there, <hi>the children of Ephraim being harneſſed, and carrying bowes, turned back in the day of battell: They kept not the Covenant of God.</hi> The <hi>Children of Ephraim</hi> were daring men, <hi>couragious men, mighty men of valour:</hi> for ſo we reade of them in Scripture. The <hi>children of Ephraim, being Armed,</hi> that is with <hi>defenſive Armes:</hi> it may be as compleatly armed as that gyant of Gath, that had a hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met of braſſe, and a ſhield of braſſe and greaves of braſſe; <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med</hi> they were: and <hi>carrying bowes:</hi> furniſhed with <hi>offenſive armes</hi> that could <hi>eminus ferire,</hi> reach their Enemies at the beſt advantage at diſtance. <hi>The children of Ephraim being</hi> thus <hi>armed and carrying bowes,</hi> turned back in the day of <hi>battle;</hi> what ayled thee <hi>ô Ephraim</hi> that thou wert affraid? what ayled thee <hi>ô Ephraim</hi> that thou fleddeſt backward? <hi>They kept not the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of God.</hi> There, there's the reaſon, had <hi>they kept the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of God, God</hi> would have <hi>kept them;</hi> but they <hi>kept not the Covenant of God,</hi> and therefore it was not their <hi>Bow</hi> nor <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> that could <hi>keepe them: being armed, and carrying bowes they turned back in the day of Battle: They kept not the Covenant of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So <hi>Ezek.</hi> 17.11. <hi>Iehoiakim</hi> King of <hi>Iudah</hi> had made a <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> with the King of <hi>Babylon</hi> to be his Tributary, afterwards repents him; <hi>breakes</hi> his <hi>Covenant</hi> with the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> ſends to <hi>Egypt for horſes and much people, and a mighty Army.</hi> Now ſaith <hi>God, ſhall he proſper? ſhall he eſcape that doth theſe things? ſhall he breake Covenant and be delivered? verſ.</hi> 15. No: <hi>Pharoah</hi> and all his mighty <hi>Army</hi> ſhall doe him no good: <hi>They ſhall all fall by the ſword, and they that remaine of him ſhall be ſcattered towards all winds, ver.</hi> 21.
